This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies (I use npm but use whatever you like here)

```bash
npm install
```

Run the project

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

## Pagination with Rick and Morty

to see the implemented pagination, go to [http://localhost:3001/pagination](http://localhost:3001/pagination)
I am working on a server side rendered pagination and on an article on infinite scroll with react query, so you can expect this repo and the files to change :)
